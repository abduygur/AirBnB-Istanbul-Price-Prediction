# Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in using Airbnb-Istanbul Data from 2020 to better understand:

1. What is the price depends on?
2. Super Hosts 
3. Is listings prices are predictable?


# File Descriptions

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. Also there is an html file which shows the after notebooks code run.


# Results
